## Description

The function _printf() main focuse is to print a output according to a certain format. Different way to print a output is to use of format specifier.

### What is format specifier?

A format specifier in c are used to take input and print the output of a type. The symbol we use in every format specifier is %. The specifier tells the compiler about the type of data that most be given or input and the type of data that most be printed on the screen.

| Format Specifier | Used for...                                                   |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| %%               | Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.  |
| %i, %d           | Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line. |
| %s               | Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line. |
| %c               | Write a function that prints anything.                        |

## Technology

The language we use for the creation of _printf() is the C language. This low level language allow us to create and control function from scratch and define its output. We are currently in our foundation trimester of C language and we are testing our knowledge by building the _print() from scratch.

## Challenges

Some of the challenge we faced creating project were trying to make out _printf() function break and figure a solution for the problem. In addiction, try creating a function with the little information that it was given to us. This helps us develop critical thinking and emphasize collaboration. Creating the function for the conversion of intergers.

## Reference
This function work similar to ![printf(3)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html).
